#**Carrageenan Inflammation Area Using high resolution ultrasound**. The data is organized as follow: There are 6 columns, column A describe the code assigned to each individual animal. Column B represent treatment: 0=No stretch, 1= stretch. Column C refers to the time for the treatment: from 24h to 96h. Column D refers to the batch or group of samples.  Column E correspond to the weight of the tissue at the time of euthanasia in mg. Column F  represent the ultrasound area in mm2 of the inflammatory lesion per each sample.

#**Neutrophils and macrophage subpopulation**. Analysis was performed using Flow cytometry. The data set is organized as follow:
For the neutrophils data: There are 9 columns, column A indicates the code assigned to each individual animal. Column B represent treatment: 0=No stretch, 1= stretch. Column C refers to the time for the treatment: from 24h to 96h. Column D refers to the batch or group of samples. Column E indicates the type of cell. Column F is the total cell count per each sample. Column G represent the percentage (%) of live cells per sample. Column H describes the relative number (percentage-%) of CD45+ cells (leukocytes). Column I describe the relative number (percentage-%) of neutrophils.

#**For the macrophages**: There are 8 columns, column A indicates the code assigned to each individual animal. Column B represent treatment: 0=No stretch, 1= stretch. Column C refers to the time for the treatment: from 48h to 96h. Column D refers to the batch or group of samples. Column E indicates the relative number (percentage-%)    of CD45+ cells (leukocytes). Column F describe the relative number (percentage-%)  of F4/80+ cells (macrophages) . Column G describe the relative number (percentage-%)  of M1 macrophages. Column H describes the relative number (percentage-%)  of M2 macrophages.

#**Single cell and bulk library preparation and sequencing**. This information correspond to the data set representing the 13 clusters and it is  organized as follow: For each of the cell population,  classic dendritic cells 1 (cDC1), classic dendritic cells 2 (cDC2), Endothelial cells (EC), Fibroblasts (FB), inflammatory dendritic cells (iDC), M1 macrophages (M1), M2c macrophages (M2c), Mast cells (MC), Monocytes (Mo), T helper cells 1 (Th1), T helper cells 2 (Th2), M2a macrophages (M2a), M2b macrophages (M2b);  the data include 7 columns; column A include the total list of analyzed genes. Column B is the statistical significance p value, Column C represent the logarithmic of average expression or  log 2FC  per each gene. Column  D is the actual Fold change expression per each gene. Column E or pct.1, is the percentage of cells where the gene is detected in the cluster. Column F or pct.2, is the percentage of cells where the gene is detected on average in the other clusters. Column G is the adjusted p value. 

#**LC-MS/MS (Liquid Chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry)**. Data set was organized as follow: There are 5 columns describing the data: Column A describe the total  list of lipid mediators analyzed. Column B describe the average of each lipid mediator in No Stretch samples at 48h. Column C describe the average of each lipid mediator in  Stretch samples at 48h. Column D describe the average of each lipid mediator in No Stretch samples at 96h. Column E describe the average of each lipid mediator in  Stretch samples at 96h.
